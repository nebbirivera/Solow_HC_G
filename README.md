Solow economic growth model extension with human capital and government, simulation using Dynare. 

Extension based partially in 'The Solow-Swan Model with Human Capital and Government: a computational approach through MatLab'
wrote by António Neto.

Assuming a Cobb-Douglas production function, with factors of production physical capital, human capital, and labor. The economy
saves a portion of production at a constant rates, and both capital increments over time are caused by this investment (saving).

The model approaches variables with their intensive form, using discrete time laws of motion.

The model clousure is made defining the saving made by households as a portion of income, and government transfers (exogenous), 
also taking into account the assumption that the government has fiscal balance and all its spending is for transfers.
